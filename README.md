# ICD-coding

Hierarchical condition category (HCC) coding helps communicate **patient complexity** and paint a picture of the whole patient. In addition to helping predict health care resource utilization, RAF scores are used to risk adjust quality and cost metrics. By accounting for differences in **patient complexity, quality and cost performance** can be more appropriately measured. 

icd-mappings: This tool helps working with ICD codes. It maps between ICD versions (such as between **ICD9 and ICD10**). Also maps to other codings such as CCS (Computer Software Classification), and CCI (Chronic Condition Indicator). 

Icdcodex: A python library for building vector representations of ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes. Because it takes advantage of the hierarchical nature of ICD codes, it also provides these hierarchies in a **networkx** format.
